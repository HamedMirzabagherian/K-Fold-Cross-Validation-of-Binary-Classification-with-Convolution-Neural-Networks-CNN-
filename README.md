# K-Fold Cross Validation of Binary Classification with Convolution Neural Networks CNN
                                K-fold Cross Validation of binary Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

I choose the deep convolutional model to classify binary (pictures of cat & dog) problems. The 2,000 images used in this exercise are excerpted from the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset [1] available on Kaggle, which contains 25,000 images. Here, I use a subset of the full dataset to decrease training time. For both cats and dogs, there are 1,000 training images and 500 test images, so totally we have 2000 data training and 100 data testing. CNNs, because of their features, have the best performance for picture classification. Thus, I used a simple compact convolutional model by using 3 layers of Conv2D and added some other layers, Batchnormalization and Activation layers, to get better performance and the best validation accuracy. I trained our model with the binary_crossentropy loss because it's a binary classification problem and our final activation is a sigmoid. In this case, using the Adam [2], Adagrad [3], and Rthe MSprop optimization algorithm is preferable to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [4], because these have automated learning rate during training. I used Adam [5] because this shows better performance in this case. Accuracy is the best evaluation metric for classification problems, but for having confidence in model performance, some others are considered: *Precision *Recall *Kappa *ROC AUC *Confusion Matrix, and... During the preprocessing stage, after loading data, these were resized, reshaped, Normalized, and labeled for them. We do not have any class imbalance (e.g., one class is much more prevalent than the other) because the number of data in each class is equal. But if we have class imbalance, we can use class_weight, in 'model.fit'. Also, I check the data to find 'Nan', so the data doesn't have missing values data.

** 5-Fold-Cross Validation (Blocks 10, 11, and 12) K-fold cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance of a model by dividing the training data into K subsets (folds). The model is trained on K-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold in each iteration. This process is repeated K times, with each fold serving as the validation set exactly once. The average performance across all K iterations is used to evaluate the model's effectiveness and generalization to unseen data.

Here I implemented K-Fold Cross Validation on the train and validation data altogether. For this, firstly, I concatenated train and valid data and then ran K-Fold. Now we can get the average of all scores and see the variation of them during K-Fold. For example, for accuracy: 73.10(Mean) +/- 2.13

This can contribute to improving model transparency and accountability in the following ways:

Reduced Overfitting and Generalization: By splitting the data into multiple subsets (folds) and training the model on different combinations of training and validation sets, K-Fold cross-validation helps in reducing overfitting. Models that generalize well to unseen data are more transparent and can be held more accountable for their predictions.

Robust Evaluation of Model Performance: Through K-Fold Cross Validation, the model's performance is evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, providing a more robust assessment of its capabilities. This thorough evaluation process enhances the accountability of the model by demonstrating how well it performs across different data splits.

Identification of Model Bias and Variance: K-Fold Cross Validation can help in identifying model bias and variance by examining the consistency of model performance across the folds. Models with high bias or variance can be more easily detected through this cross-validation technique, allowing for adjustments to be made to improve model transparency and accountability.

Validation of Model Stability: By testing the model on multiple subsets of the data, K-Fold Cross Validation enables the evaluation of model stability. A stable model that consistently performs well across different data splits enhances transparency by demonstrating its reliability and accountability by showing reproducibility.

Documentation and Interpretation of Results: Utilizing K-Fold Cross Validation allows for the documentation of model performance metrics across multiple folds, providing a clearer picture of the model's behavior. This documentation enhances transparency by detailing the model's performance under different conditions, making it more understandable and interpretable.

Incorporating K-Fold Cross Validation into the model development process can lead to more transparent and accountable machine learning models by promoting generalization, robust evaluation, identification of biases, validation of model stability, and detailed documentation of results.

** Analyzing and interpreting the model based on the results of Precision, Recall, F1 score, Cohen's Kappa, and ROC AUC. (Block 9)

A. The results: Accuracy: 0.742000 Precision: 0.742000 F1 score: 0.742000 Cohen's kappa: 0.484000 ROC AUC: 0.742000 Recall: 0.742000

• Confusion matrix, Block 9, shows the ability of models to classify two classes. The model has 120 wrong samples for cat classification and 130 wrong samples for dog classification. Actually, models have less ability to classify dog pictures, because more wrongs happen for dog pictures. If classifying dogs is more important than cats, we must work on the structure of the model to solve this problem or increase the data of dogs in the training data set.

• Accuracy = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN The high accuracy of the model presented indicates the high ability of networks to classify unseen data and their high generalization properly. High Accuracy: A high accuracy value indicates that the model is making correct predictions in a large majority of instances. This suggests that the model is performing well in general and is able to classify instances correctly. Low Accuracy: A low accuracy value may indicate that the model is making a significant number of incorrect predictions. This could be due to various factors such as biases in the data, an imbalance in the classes, or suboptimal model parameters. When interpreting accuracy, it is important to consider the context of the problem and any class imbalances that may affect the metric. In situations where there is a significant class imbalance (e.g., one class is much more prevalent than the other), accuracy may not be the most informative metric. In such cases, it is essential to consider additional metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or ROC AUC to get a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

• Precision = tp / (tp + fp) Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances that are predicted as positive. A high precision value indicates that the model makes few false positive predictions. A low precision value may suggest that the model is incorrectly classifying negative instances as positive.

• Recall = tp / (tp + fn) Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all actual positive instances. A high recall value indicates that the model is capturing most of the positive instances. A low recall value may suggest that the model is missing some positive instances.

• F1 score = 2 tp / (2 tp + fp + fn) The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate model performance. A high F1 score indicates a balance between precision and recall, while a low F1 score may suggest an imbalance in the model's performance.

• Cohen's Kappa = P0 - Pe/ 1 - Pe P0 = classification accuracy Pe = the random classification result and Cohen's Kappa is a statistic that measures the agreement between the model's predictions and the actual labels while accounting for the agreement that would be expected by chance. A high Kappa value indicates a strong agreement between the model's predictions and the ground truth labels, beyond what would be expected by random chance. A low Kappa value may suggest inconsistencies or biases in the model's predictions.

• ROC AUC: The ROC AUC metric evaluates the performance of a binary classifier by measuring the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. A higher ROC AUC score (closer to 1) indicates better overall performance of the model in distinguishing between positive and negative instances. A score of 0.5 suggests that the model is performing no better than random chance.

B. To analyze these metrics and interpret the results:

• High Cohen's Kappa, ROC AUC, and Recall values generally indicate that the model is effective in making accurate predictions and distinguishing between positive and negative instances.

• Low Cohen's Kappa, ROC AUC, or Recall values suggest potential issues with the model's performance, such as misclassifications, biases, or suboptimal predictive ability.

• Discrepancies between the model's performance on training and test data may indicate overfitting or underfitting. Here this problem does not exist because the metrics of train and validation are close.

• High precision but low recall may indicate that the model is overly conservative in making positive predictions.

• Unequal performance across different classes may indicate biases in the model's training data or algorithm. In Block 9, getting scores for each class show the same number nearly.

• Accuracy, Precision, and F1-score criteria show the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total predictions made by the model. The ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples classified correctly and incorrectly by the model in a specific class and the weighted average of precision and recall metrics, respectively.

C. To improve the model's performance based on these metrics, implementing techniques like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, optimizing model parameters, collecting more diverse training data, and exploring different machine learning algorithms or data augmentation can be helpful. I think that increasing the number of data sets is more effective. Accordingly, monitoring these metrics can help us to identify areas of improvement and ensure the model's effectiveness and fairness.
